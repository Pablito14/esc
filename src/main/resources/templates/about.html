            <h4>Operation: saving you </h4>
            <p>Come on, lets be honest... We don't always mean it when we agree we want to hangout, or maybe you do initially and then it ends up being really boring, you get tired, they start annoying you, or maybe it's about to go  too crazy and your friends are about to do something not okay and you need to get out of there. Either way, we know what it's like to have to leave those situations and not want to look bad! We created escape as a solution to answer these types of problems and we hope you are happy with our application.</p>
