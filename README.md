## Description
Esc (pronounced escape) is an app that allows a user to compose a message, specify a time the user wants to receive that message, and then delivers that message as an SMS at the specified time.

Practicle Application:
* When you commit to a social engagement and want to have an excuse to leave early
* To send yourself a reminder
* To impress someone who might have visual access to your phone

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to send myself a text message (that I wrote) at a time that I specified, so that can use the text as an excuse to get out of uncomfortable situations, remind myself to do something or impress someone.

## Possible Features
* Dead Man's Switch: sends a message to someone after a specified set of time, if the user doesn't respond, sends an SMS to the people the user specified

## Third Party Resources:
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms)
